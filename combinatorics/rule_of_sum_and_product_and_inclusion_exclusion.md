# Rule Of Product / Sum
The rule of product states that if there are `n` ways of doing something, and `m` ways of doing another thing after that,
then there are `n*m` ways to perform both of these actions.

The rule of sum is a basic counting approach in combinatorics. A basic statement of the rule is that if there are `n` 
choices for one action and `m` choices for another action, and the two actions cannot be done at the same time,
then there are `n+m` ways to choose one of these actions.

# Principle of inclusion and exclusion
The principle of inclusion and exclusion (PIE) is a counting technique that computes the number of elements that satisfy
at least one of several properties while guaranteeing that elements satisfying more than one property are not counted twice.
