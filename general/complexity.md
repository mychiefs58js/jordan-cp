# Time Complexity

When there is more than one way to solve a problem. We need to learn how to compare 
their performances to choose the best one.
The exact time needed for a program to finish executing depends on lots of things like hardware, operating system, processors, etc. However, we don't consider any of these factors while analyzing an algorithm. We will only consider the execution time of the algorithm with respect to the size of input fed to the program. This measurement is called "Time Complexity" or "Order of Growth".
