# Competitive Programming

**Competitive programming** is a mind sport usually held over the Internet or a local network, involving participants trying to program according to provided specifications.

## Objectives

* Benefits of Competitive Programming.
* How to prepare yourself for Competitive Programming.
* How to get engaged with Jordanian Competitive Programmers.


## benefits of competitive programming

### 1. Competitive Programming improves your coding and implementation skills

  Implementation skill is one of the important programming skills, and as a Competitive Programmer, you have to be able to translate any idea to code, and this is the first skill you will learn as a Competitive Programmer.
In programming competitions you have to write an algorithm to solve a specific problem, then you must implement it in any programming language.
so without implementation skills, you won't be able to solve the problem.

### 2. Enhances problem-solving skills

  As we all know, Competitive Programming is the brain game, which tests your basic to advanced problem-solving skills.
The ability to solve problems is a basic life skill and is essential to our day-to-day lives, at home, at school, and at work.
Good problem-solving skills empower you not only in your personal life but are critical in your professional life.
Competitive Programming teaches you to find the easiest solution in the quickest possible way.
CP enhances your problem-solving and debugging skills giving you real-time fun.
ItÂ’s brain-sport. As you start solving harder and harder problems in live-contests your analytical and rational thinking intensifies.

### 3. Learn how to work in a Team

Many contests require team participation. You learn how to show a genuine commitment to the team and how to contribute a bit in the team's work. Develop a team mentality. Think we, not me.

## How to prepare yourself for Competitive Programming

#### 1. Choose Programming Language
In the official contests (C++, Java) are used, the majority of a competitive programmer is using c++.

#### 2. Understand the Concept of Time and Space Complexity

Usually, there are many solutions, So Time Complexity give us a hint of how fast the solution is, Please read `Time Complexity`
from blogs page

#### 3. Learn the Fundamentals of Data Structures and Algorithms
Please read `Standard Template Library STL` to learn the basic tools you need.

#### 4. Practice and Do it Regularly

Use online judges for practice, `codeforces` is the most popular platform for practicing.
try to solve the most solved questions (https://codeforces.com/problemset?order=BY_SOLVED_DESC), and make sure you always
ask experienced people from the local community as they can provide you a Roadmap of how to learn the topics.

You can find a lot of resources on this website but there isn't a RoadMap yet. 

#### 5. Get engaged in the local community

Join `ACM - JCPC` (https://www.facebook.com/groups/357325854467689/) group on facebook,
Also check out the national contests for jordan on Facebook 'https://www.facebook.com/JordanCPC/' and  `https://www.facebook.com/JordanianOI/'.


Good Luck with your journey and wish you the best of luck.
